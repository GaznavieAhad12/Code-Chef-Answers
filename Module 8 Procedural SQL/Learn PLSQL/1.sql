-- Introduction to PL-SQL
-- In Oracle database management, PL/SQL is a procedural language extension to Structured Query Language (SQL). The purpose of PL/SQL is to combine database language and procedural programming language.

-- Imagine you have a recipe book (your database) and you want to make a cake (perform a task).
-- Procedural SQL is like writing down each step of the recipe in detail, from gathering ingredients to baking the cake, rather than just listing the ingredients (which is more like our regular SQL).
-- For example, you might tell the database to:

-- Get the list of ingredients (SELECT statement).
-- Mix the ingredients together in a bowl (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements).
-- Pour the mixture into a cake pan (INSERT statement).
-- Bake the cake in the oven (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements).
-- Take the cake out of the oven (SELECT statement).
-- Serve the cake (SELECT statement).
-- Each step in the process is like a line of code in procedural SQL.
-- This approach gives you more control over how tasks are performed and allows you to handle more complex operations than simple queries.
