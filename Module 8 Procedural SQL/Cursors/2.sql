-- Implicit cursors
-- Implicit cursors are automatically created by PL/SQL for SQL statements that are not explicitly assigned to a cursor variable.
-- They are typically used for single-row queries or DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT INTO.
-- Implicit cursors are limited in functionality compared to explicit cursors, but they are simpler to use for straightforward queries.

-- Check-out the syntax for implicit cursors.
-- Run the code in the IDE to check the output.
