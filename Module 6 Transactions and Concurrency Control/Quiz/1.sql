Explanation:
2 Phase Locking (2PL) is a concurrency control method that guarantees serializability. The protocol utilizes locks, applied by a transaction to data, which may block (interpreted as signals to stop) other transactions from accessing the same data during the transactionâ€™s life. 2PL may be lead to deadlocks that result from the mutual blocking of two or more transactions. See the following situation, neither T3 nor T4 can make progress.

Timestamp-based concurrency control algorithm is a non-lock concurrency control method. In Timestamp based method, deadlock cannot occur as no transaction ever waits.
