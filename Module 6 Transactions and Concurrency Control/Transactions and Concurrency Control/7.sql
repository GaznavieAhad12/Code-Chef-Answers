-- Deadlock in DBMS
-- Deadlock in DBMS is like a traffic jam of transactions. It occurs when two or more transactions are stuck, each waiting for a resource the other holds, causing a standstill in database activity.

-- Understanding Deadlock
-- Imagine two cars facing each other in a narrow lane, unable to move because neither can reverse. Deadlock occurs when transactions reach a point where none can proceed, leading to a state of inactivity.

-- Key Components
-- Mutual Exclusion: Transactions require exclusive access to certain resources. This exclusivity can lead to contention, especially if transactions hold resources while waiting for others.

-- Hold and Wait: Transactions holding resources are waiting for more resources. This can create a chain reaction of transactions waiting for each other's resources.

-- No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a transaction. This contributes to the standstill as transactions wait for resources to be released.

-- Circular Wait: Transactions form a circular chain where each is waiting for a resource held by the next, creating a deadlock situation.

-- Detecting and Handling Deadlocks
-- Timeouts: If a transaction waits too long, it might be aborted, releasing its held resources.

-- Resource Allocation Graph: A graph is used to represent transactions and resources, helping to identify circular waits and potential deadlocks.

-- Deadlock Prevention: Ensure that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur. However, this might impact system efficiency.

-- Deadlock Detection: Periodically check for circular wait conditions and take corrective actions if detected.

-- Example
-- Imagine two transactionsâ€”one wants to withdraw money and the other wants to transfer money. If both transactions are waiting for the other to release resources, a deadlock occurs.
