-- Case Study: An Online Marketplace
-- Imagine an online marketplace where users can buy and sell products. The system records transactions, manages inventory, and ensures data integrity. Let's explore concepts related to serializability, recoverability, and deadlocks in this context.

-- Question 1: In the context of our online marketplace, serializability ensures:
-- A) All transactions are executed concurrently without any coordination.

-- B) Transactions are executed in a way that maintains data consistency.

-- C) Transactions are executed without any regard for data integrity.

-- D) Transactions are executed in a random order to enhance efficiency.

-- Question 2: How does recoverability contribute to our online marketplace's reliability?
-- A) It ensures that transactions can be executed concurrently without any restrictions.

-- B) It guarantees that transactions are never rolled back, even after system crashes.

-- C) It allows transactions to be committed without being logged.

-- D) It ensures that the database can return to a consistent state after failures.

-- Question 3: In the context of our online marketplace, what could potentially lead to a deadlock situation?
-- A) Users can buy and sell products concurrently without any restrictions.

-- B) Transactions holding certain resources are waiting for other resources held by different transactions.

-- C) Transactions are automatically aborted if they wait for resources too long.

-- D) Transactions are never allowed to hold any resources, preventing contention.

-- Question 4: What is a common strategy to handle deadlocks in our online marketplace's DBMS?
-- A) Allowing transactions to indefinitely hold resources until they are completed.

-- B) Forcing transactions to release resources held for a long time.

-- C) Creating a circular wait condition intentionally to improve system efficiency.

-- D) Periodically checking for circular wait conditions and taking corrective actions.

-- Question 5: How can we prevent deadlocks in our online marketplace's DBMS?
-- A) Ensuring that transactions never hold any resources.

-- B) Allowing transactions to wait indefinitely for resources.

-- C) Guaranteeing that transactions never wait for resources.

-- D) Ensuring that at least one of the necessary deadlock conditions cannot occur.

Correct Answer:

1. B, 2. D, 3. B, 4. D, 5. D
Explanation:
1. Answer: B) 
Explanation: Serializability ensures that transactions are executed in an order that preserves data integrity and consistency, even when transactions are executed concurrently.

2. Answer: D) 
Explanation: Recoverability ensures that in case of system crashes or failures, the database can be restored to a known and consistent state, safeguarding data reliability.

3. Answer: B) 
Explanation: Deadlocks occur when transactions are stuck in a circular wait, each holding a resource that the other needs. This results in a standstill.

4. Answer: D) 
Explanation: A common strategy to handle deadlocks is periodically detecting circular waits using techniques like resource allocation graphs and taking actions to break the deadlock.

5. Answer: D) 
Explanation: Preventing deadlocks involves designing the system in a way that avoids at least one of the conditions that can lead to deadlocks, ensuring that deadlocks are impossible.
