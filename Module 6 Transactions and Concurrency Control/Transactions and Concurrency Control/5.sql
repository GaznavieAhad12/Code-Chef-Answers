-- Serializability in DBMS
-- Serializability in DBMS maintains a smooth flow of transactions. It ensures that even when multiple actions happen simultaneously, the final result aligns with a sequential execution, safeguarding data reliability.

-- How Serializability Works
-- Conflict Resolution: Transactions involving reading and writing data need orderly execution. If conflicts arise, the order is carefully managed.

-- Precedence Graph: A precedence graph is used to organize conflicting operations, ensuring transactions run coherently.

-- Types of Schedules
-- Serializable Schedules: These schedules preserve the same outcome as if executed one after another, guaranteeing data integrity.

-- Non-Serializable Schedules: These may lead to different outcomes, causing data inconsistencies.

-- Example
-- For instance, in concurrent transactions involving money deduction and addition, serializability ensures the proper order to maintain the account balance accurately.
