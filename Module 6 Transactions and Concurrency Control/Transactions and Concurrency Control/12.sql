Correct Answer:

1. B, 2. B, 3. C, 4. B, 5. C
Explanation:
Here are explanations for each MCQ:

Question 1 Explanation: Concurrency control in DBMS aims to ensure that multiple transactions execute harmoniously, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency. It manages the simultaneous execution of transactions without compromising data integrity.

Question 2 Explanation: In a distributed database system, data is divided and stored across multiple locations or sites. This enhances data availability, performance, and geographical independence, allowing users to access data regardless of their location.

Question 3 Explanation: Query optimization in DBMS is the process of selecting the most efficient execution plan for a query. It minimizes response time, resource usage, and disk access, ensuring queries are executed swiftly and with optimal resource utilization.

Question 4 Explanation: Serializability is the mechanism that ensures multiple transactions do not interfere with each other's data. It guarantees that concurrent transactions execute in an order that maintains data consistency and integrity.

Question 5  Explanation: Data replication in a distributed database system involves redundant storage of data across multiple sites. It enhances data availability, fault tolerance, and response times by allowing multiple copies of data to be accessed.
