-- Concurrency Control in DBMS
-- Concurrency control in DBMS is like conducting a symphony of simultaneous transactions. It ensures that multiple actions happen in harmony while preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

-- Understanding Concurrency Control:

-- Imagine multiple musicians playing different instruments in an orchestra. Concurrency control ensures that their actions synchronize beautifully to create a unified performance.

-- Managing Concurrency:

-- Isolation Levels: Different levels of isolation control how transactions interact. Higher isolation ensures more control but might impact performance.

-- Locking Mechanisms: Transactions request locks to access resources. Locks can be exclusive (write) or shared (read), preventing conflicting actions.

-- Two-Phase Locking: Transactions follow a protocol—acquire all locks before proceeding and release all locks after—minimizing conflicts.

-- Timestamp Ordering: Each transaction is assigned a timestamp. The order of execution is based on timestamps, preventing conflicts.

-- Conflicts and Anomalies:

-- Dirty Reads: A transaction reads uncommitted data from another, causing inconsistencies.

-- Unrepeatable Reads: A transaction reads data, but the data changes before the transaction completes, leading to unexpected results.

-- Phantom Reads: A transaction reads a set of data, but another transaction adds or removes data in between, causing unexpected changes.

-- Example:

-- Imagine an e-commerce website. Concurrency control ensures that while one user is adding items to their cart, another user can still search for products without causing data inconsistencies.
