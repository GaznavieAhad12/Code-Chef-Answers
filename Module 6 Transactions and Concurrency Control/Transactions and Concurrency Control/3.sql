-- Schedule in DBMS
-- Database scheduling is like a conductor managing a symphony of transactions. It ensures that multiple actions run smoothly while maintaining data integrity.

-- Types of Scheduling: Solo or Ensemble
-- Serial Schedule: Transactions take turns, one after another. Guarantees consistency but might be slower.

-- Concurrent Schedule: Transactions perform simultaneously, improving efficiency. Requires control to avoid conflicts.

-- Concurrency Control: Keeping the Beat
-- Locking resources prevents clashes between transactions, maintaining harmony in a concurrent environment.

-- Example: Booking Flights
-- Scheduling prevents double bookings. One transaction completes before another starts, preventing conflicts.

-- Isolation Levels: Balancing Act
-- Isolation levels manage the trade-off between consistency and performance.
