-- Distributed Database System in DBMS
-- A distributed database system in DBMS is like a network of interconnected libraries. It spreads data across locations, enabling seamless access and interaction, regardless of distance.

-- Key Aspects:

-- Data Division: Data is fragmented and distributed to different sites, reducing network load and enhancing access.

-- Replication: Important data might be copied across sites for availability and fault tolerance.

-- Query Handling: Queries can be executed locally or globally, balancing efficiency and optimization.

-- Benefits:

-- Scalability: New sites can be added as data grows, ensuring the system adapts to increasing demands.

-- Reliability: Even if some sites fail, data remains accessible due to distribution and replication.

-- Performance: Data distribution reduces network congestion and speeds up responses.

-- Challenges:

-- Data Consistency: Maintaining data accuracy across sites requires careful synchronization.

-- Transaction Control: Coordinating transactions across locations while preserving ACID properties is complex.

-- Example:

-- Imagine a global retailer with distributed databases in different regions, allowing local teams to access inventory, sales, and customer data, enhancing efficiency.

-- Summary:

-- A distributed database system links data across locations, enabling seamless access. It optimizes scalability, availability, and performance while managing challenges like data consistency and transaction coordination.
